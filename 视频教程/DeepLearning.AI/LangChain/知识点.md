So far I've been the only one using it, and I've been \

# Memory

## ConversationBufferMemory
将聊天记录全部放在内存中。
```python 
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0)
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm, 
    memory = memory,
    verbose=True
)
```


## ConversationBufferWindowMemory
与ConversationBufferMemory增加了参数，用来保存指定轮次的对话数。
```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0)
memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1)
conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm, 
    memory = memory,
    verbose=False
)
```
            
## ConversationTokenBufferMemory
限定保存的token数量
```
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0)
memory = ConversationTokenBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=30)
```

## ConversationSummaryMemory
限定保存的token数量，对于内存中的内容会去做summary以节省token
```
memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=100)
conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm, 
    memory = memory,
    verbose=True
)
```
# Chains in LangChain
## LLMChain
A LLMChain is the most common type of chain. It consists of a PromptTemplate, a model (either an LLM or a ChatModel), and an optional output parser. This chain takes multiple input variables, uses the PromptTemplate to format them into a prompt. It then passes that to the model. Finally, it uses the OutputParser (if provided) to parse the output of the LLM into a final format.

```
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.9)

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
    "What is the best name to describe \
    a company that makes {product}?"
)

chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)
product = "Queen Size Sheet Set"
chain.run(product)

```

## SimpleSequentialChain
The simplest form of sequential chains, where each step has a singular input/output, and the output of one step is the input to the next.

```
from langchain.chains import SimpleSequentialChain

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.9)

# prompt template 1
first_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
    "What is the best name to describe \
    a company that makes {product}?"
)

# Chain 1
chain_one = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=first_prompt)

# prompt template 2
second_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
    "Write a 20 words description for the following \
    company:{company_name}"
)
# chain 2
chain_two = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=second_prompt)

overall_simple_chain = SimpleSequentialChain(chains=[chain_one, chain_two],
                                             verbose=True
                                            )
product = "Queen Size Sheet Set"
overall_simple_chain.run(product)

```

## SequentialChain
A more general form of sequential chains, allowing for multiple inputs/outputs.
```
from langchain.chains import SequentialChain
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.9)

# prompt template 1: translate to english
first_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
    "Translate the following review to english:"
    "\n\n{Review}"
)
#chain 1: input= Review and output= English_Review
chain_one = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=first_prompt, 
                     output_key="English_Review"
                    )

second_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
    "Can you summarize the following review in 1 sentence:"
    "\n\n{English_Review}"
)
# chain 2: input= English_Review and output= summary
chain_two = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=second_prompt, 
                     output_key="summary"
                    )
# prompt template 3: translate to english
third_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
    "What language is the following review:\n\n{Review}"
)
# chain 3: input= Review and output= language
chain_three = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=third_prompt,
                       output_key="language"
                      )
# prompt template 4: follow up message
fourth_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
    "Write a follow up response to the following "
    "summary in the specified language:"
    "\n\nSummary: {summary}\n\nLanguage: {language}"
)
# chain 4: input= summary, language and output= followup_message
chain_four = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=fourth_prompt,
                      output_key="followup_message"
                     )
# overall_chain: input= Review 
# and output= English_Review,summary, followup_message
overall_chain = SequentialChain(
    chains=[chain_one, chain_two, chain_three, chain_four],
    input_variables=["Review"],
    output_variables=["English_Review", "summary","followup_message"],
    verbose=True
